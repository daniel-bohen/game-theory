## Game Solvers 
### Normal form game solver
Finds all pure strategy equilibria for 2x2 to 4x4 games and unique mixed strategy equilibria for 2x2 games.
Finds mixed strategy equilibria and simulates play for up to 5x5 games.
Finds all equilibria, expected payoffs, and connected components of bimatrix games.

### Extensive form game solver
Finds all pure strategy equilibria for sequential games of perfect information with up to four players.

### Hawk-dove ESS solver
Finds the evolutionarily-stable strategies for a 2x2 game.

### LP explorer
Interactively solve linear programming problems using the simplex method.

### Power indices of voting games
Calculate the Shapley-Shubik Index and others for various voting rules.

### QSC-Outcome-Tools
Design, run, and analyze outcomes of normal-form and sequential games. Includes a package of commands for python for solving extensive form games and zero-sum games.

## Mixed Strategies
### Repeated mixed strategies
How well can you generate a sequence of "random" strategies?

### Rock-paper-scissors
Sophisticated RPS game where the computer uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to outguess you! Also implements simple predetermined chance. 

### Quaak!
Play a betting-and-bluffing game against an "optimal" mixed strategy.

## Risk 
### Winner's curse
How much should one offer for a company with uncertain value?

### Order statistic experiment
Calculates distributions of order statistics useful for determining auction prices.

### Certainty equivalents
A discussion and applet illustrating certainty equivalents for gambles.

## Evolution
### Evolution of cooperation
Simulates the success obtained by a mutant population playing the prisoner's dilemma against an established population.

### Spatial iterated prisoner's dilemma
Simulates the evolution of cooperation or defection due to local interaction among players on a grid.

### Evolutionary Approach to Norms
A customizable simulation of Axelrod's evolution of social norms model with related discussion and Java classes.

### Multiplayer iterated prisoner's dilemma
Simulates the evolution of cooperation or defection among several common strategies based on initial populations.

### Game of Life
A customizable simulation of Conway's game includes several interesting starting configurations.

### Fire experiment
A spatial simulation of contagion by demonstrating the spread of forest fires.

### Ecological evolution
Graphically represents the evolution of various strategies that you select when they play arbitrary 2x2 games.

### Hawks vs. doves evolution
An applet simulating the relationship between hawks (who fight for resources) and doves (who do not). Highly customizable.

### Evolutionary Network Traffic Simulator
A downloadable program and demonstration applet for simulating the evolutionary characterisitcs of traffic and congestion.
